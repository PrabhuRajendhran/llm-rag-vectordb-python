<h1 align="center">☁️🐍 Getting Started with Amazon Bedrock, RAG, and Vector database in Python</h1>

### 🔍 Introduction
In this repository, you'll find sample applications and tutorials that showcase the power of **Amazon Bedrock with Python**. These resources are designed to help Python developers understand how to harness **Amazon Bedrock** in building generative AI-enabled applications. You'll also discover how to integrate Bedrock with vector databases using `RAG (Retrieval-augmented generation)`, and services like Amazon Aurora, RDS, and OpenSearch. Additionally, get insights into using `langchain` and `streamlit` to create applications that demonstrate your experiments effectively.
