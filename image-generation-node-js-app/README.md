# Integrated Fullstack Showcase: Harnessing Stable Diffusion AI using Amazon Bedrock

Dive into our project where we effectively utilize the Stable Diffusion AI model using Amazon Bedrock. This repository offers an in-depth guide to constructing both the frontend and backend aspects of our application.

### Backend Architecture:
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Serving as the foundational layer for our AI operations.
- **Lambda**: The serverless compute service we use to execute code in response to specific events.
- **API Gateway**: A tool that allows us to establish, distribute, and safeguard our APIs with ease.

### Frontend Design:
Our user interface is meticulously crafted with the React framework and effortlessly deployed and hosted via **Amplify**.
